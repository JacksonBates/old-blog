= Days 00001010 and 00001011
:hp-tags: React, tensorflow, async woes

== The coding
The last couple of days have been characterised by more banging my head against React. I have managed to have a table correctly populated, solving the previous day's problem, and I have even managed to read the data from an API and have that populate the table, too.

However, the code for that final solution smells a little callback-hellish to me, and I am sure there is probably a better way to do it.

== The offending code


[source, html]
:language: html
----
let APICampers = [];

fetch('https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent')
.then((response) => response.json())
.then((data) => APICampers = data)
.then(() => {
  for (let i = 0; i < APICampers.length; i++) {
    APICampers[i]["rank"] = i + 1;
  };
})
.then(() => {
  const app = document.getElementById('app');
  ReactDOM.render(<CamperTable campers={APICampers} />, app);
});
