== Today's coding
Another cheat day today. I couldn't be bothered with React, and someone made a really simple API for the quote generator project. I fancied playing with it to see if my callback chops have gotten any better (they have).

The pen can be found here: http://codepen.io/Malgalin/full/vKABrY/

I am now going to investigate the banging noise downstairs.

If I do not post tomorrow, avenge my death.
