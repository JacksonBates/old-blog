=== Smooth Scrolling fix

I still had a problem to solve from yesterday: how to fix the smooth scrolling to the top of the page?

The solution was simple, but that doesn't mean I found it straight away! You may already know that a `href='#top'` will automatically link to the top of the webpage without any explicit references to it on the page...but did you know that the link:https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/[smooth scroll] snippet I linked to yesterday _does_ require that reference on the page? Well you do now. I added `<a id="top"></a>` just under the nav bar and the smooth scrolling implemented perfectly.

TIP: Read your jQuery snippets collected from the corner of the web to look for clues!
