## The coding

The last two days have been 'cheat days' of a sort. I've spent a little time helping put out spot fires on the FreeCodeCamp forums when simple issues have arisen, but the bulk of my designated coding time has been spent setting up a new Linux workspace.

I've used a few distros in the past, so I was keen to try something new and to learn some new things, and thought I'd give Arch a crack.

I was originally going to take the easy route and use Evo/Lution (or Makeiso, as it is called now) to install Arch (hardly the Arch Way, I know), but I was having trouble with getting it to work as a live usb. So I did try to install Arch. I made the mistake of beginning that quite late at night, though, and in the morning it had lost its appeal!

Enter Antergos.

I hadn't heard of Antergos before, but someone mentioned it as an easier alternative on the Melbourne FreeCodeCamp Slack channel for out meet-up group. It offered the installer approach I was looking for in Makeiso, so it seemed a slam dunk.

The thing with installers, though, is that just because they provide you with a GUI and some automated scripts, it doesn't mean you don't have to know what you are doing.

## The problem

I muddled my way through the incredibly long installation process and everything seemed fine. I'm dual booting, so when I saw the GRUB loader menu offering Antergos and Windows 10 I assumed everything was completed.

When I selected my new Linux setup, though, after a few moments of generic screen tett output I was met with a blinking, non-responsive cursor. At first I just thought it was taking a while to load and not reporting on its processes, but after a few minutes it became clear that this was my new development environment. Google and some Arch / Antergos forums informed me it was likely a problem caused by Nvidia proprietary drivers.

I managed to boot up the non-desktop version with `ctrl + alt + F2` but all of the advice for getting the right drivers did nothing to help me. It seemed that starting again with a clean install guided by the docs was the way to go.

## The solution

In the end I bit the bullet and went through another hour-long install, this time painstakingly double checking every setting against whatever Google could offer me. It turns out the offending setting was the option to install proprietary drivers. Apparently _NOT_ installing the drivers designed for you Nvidia card is a better solution than installing them. So there you go. Sometimes the opposite thing to the most intuitively obvious solution is the real solution.

Anyway, it's all running smoothly now. I've got node, npm, atom and some other goodies installed, som hopefully I can get some productive coding done tomorrow.
